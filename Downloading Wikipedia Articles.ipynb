As a result, the [[expectation value|expected]] statistical frequency distribution of subsystem states has the Boltzmann form.\\n\",\n",
       " b'; [[Maxwell\\xe2\\x80\\x93Boltzmann statistics]] of classical gases (systems of non-interacting particles)\\n',\n",
       " b': In particle systems, many particles share the same space and regularly change places with each other; the single-particle state space they occupy is a shared space. [[Maxwell\\xe2\\x80\\x93Boltzmann statistics]] give the expected number of particles found in a given single-particle state, in a [[classical mechanics|classical]] gas of non-interacting particles at equilibrium. This expected number distribution has the Boltzmann form.\\n',\n",
       " b'\\n',\n",
       " b'Although these cases have strong similarities, it is helpful to distinguish them as they generalize in different ways when the crucial assumptions are changed:\\n',\n",
       " b\"* When a system is in thermodynamic equilibrium with respect to both energy exchange ''and particle exchange'', the requirement of fixed composition is relaxed and a [[grand canonical ensemble]] is obtained rather than canonical ensemble. On the other hand, if both composition and energy are fixed, then a [[microcanonical ensemble]] applies instead.\\n\",\n",
       " b\"* If the subsystems within a collection ''do'' interact with each other, then the expected frequencies of subsystem states no longer follow a Boltzmann distribution, and even may not have an [[analytical solution]].&lt;ref&gt;A classic example of this is [[magnetic ordering]]. Systems of non-interacting [[spin (physics)|spins]] show [[paramagnetic]] behaviour that can be understood with a single-particle canonical ensemble (resulting in the [[Brillouin function]]). Systems of ''interacting'' spins can show much more complex behaviour such as [[ferromagnetism]] or [[antiferromagnetism]].&lt;/ref&gt; The canonical ensemble can however still be applied to the ''collective'' states of the entire system considered as a whole, provided the entire system is isolated and in thermal equilibrium.\\n\",\n",
       " b\"* With ''[[quantum mechanics|quantum]]'' gases of non-interacting particles in equilibrium, the number of particles found in a given single-particle state does not follow Maxwell\\xe2\\x80\\x93Boltzmann statistics, and there is no simple closed form expression for quantum gases in the canonical ensemble. In the grand canonical ensemble the state-filling statistics of quantum gases are described by [[Fermi\\xe2\\x80\\x93Dirac statistics]] or [[Bose\\xe2\\x80\\x93Einstein statistics]], depending on whether the particles are [[fermion]]s or [[boson]]s respectively.\\n\",\n",

       " b\"'''Leg theory''' is a [[bowling (cricket)|bowling]] tactic in the [[sport]] of [[cricket]].&lt;ref name=&quot;merriam-webster.com - Definition of LEG THEORY&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/leg%20theory|title=Definition of LEG THEORY|work=merriam-webster.com|publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]]|accessdate=6 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''leg theory'' is somewhat archaic and seldom used any longer, but the basic tactic remains a play in modern cricket.\\n\",\n",
       " b'\\n',\n",
       " b'Simply put, leg theory involves concentrating the bowling attack at or near the [[line and length|line]] of [[stump (cricket)|leg stump]]. This may or may not be accompanied by a concentration of [[fielding positions in cricket|fielders]] on the [[leg side]]. The line of attack aims to cramp the [[batsman]], making him play the [[cricket ball|ball]] with the [[cricket bat|bat]] close to the body. This makes it difficult to hit the ball freely and score runs, especially on the [[Fielding (cricket)#Off and leg side fields|off side]]. Since a leg theory attack means the batsman is more likely to hit the ball on the leg side, additional fielders on that side of the field can be effective in preventing runs and taking catches.\\n',\n",
       " b'\\n',\n",
       " b'Stifling the batsman in this manner can lead to impatience and frustration, resulting in rash play by the batsman which in turn can lead to a quick dismissal.\\n',\n",
       " b'\\n',\n",
       " b'Leg theory can be a moderately successful tactic when used with both [[fast bowling]] and [[spin bowling]], particularly [[leg spin]] to right-handed batsmen or [[off spin]] to left-handed batsmen. However, because it relies on lack of concentration or discipline by the batsman, it can be risky against patient and skilled players, especially batsmen who are strong on the leg side. The English opening bowlers [[Sydney Barnes]] and [[Frank Foster (cricketer)|Frank Foster]] used leg theory with some success in Australia in 1911-12. In England, at around the same time [[Fred Root]] was one of the main proponents of the same tactic.\\n',\n",
       " b'\\n',\n",
       " b'Concentrating attack on the leg stump is considered by many cricket fans and commentators to lead to boring play, as it stifles run scoring and encourages batsmen to play conservatively.\\n',\n",
       " b'\\n',\n",
       " b'==Fast leg theory==\\n',\n",
       " b'{{Main|Bodyline}}\\n',\n",
       " b'\\n',\n",
       " b\"In 1930, [[England cricket team|England]] captain [[Douglas Jardine]], together with [[Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club|Nottinghamshire]]'s captain [[Arthur Carr (cricketer)|Arthur Carr]] and his bowlers [[Harold Larwood]] and [[Bill Voce]], developed a variant of leg theory in which the bowlers bowled fast, short-pitched balls that would rise into the batsman's body, together with a heavily stacked ring of close fielders on the leg side. The idea was that when the batsman defended against the ball, he would be likely to deflect the ball into the air for a catch.\\n\",\n",
       " b'\\n',\n",
       " b\"Jardine called this modified form of the tactic ''fast leg theory''. On the 1932-33 English tour of [[Australia]], Larwood and Voce bowled fast leg theory at the Australian batsmen. It turned out to be extremely dangerous, and most Australian players sustained injuries from being hit by the ball. [[Wicket-keeper]] [[Bert Oldfield]]'s skull was fractured by a ball hitting his head (although the ball had first glanced off the bat and Larwood had an orthodox field), almost precipitating a riot by the Australian crowd.\\n\",\n",
       " b'\\n',\n",
       " b\"The Australian press dubbed the tactic ''[[Bodyline]]'', and claimed it was a deliberate attempt by the English team to intimidate and injure the Australian players. Reports of the controversy reaching England at the time described the bowling as ''fast leg theory'', which sounded to many people to be a harmless and well-established tactic. This led to a serious misunderstanding amongst the English public and the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] - the administrators of English cricket - of the dangers posed by Bodyline. The English press and cricket authorities declared the Australian protests to be a case of sore losing and &quot;squealing&quot;.\\n\",\n",
       " b'\\n',\n",
       " b'It was only with the return of the English team and the subsequent use of Bodyline against English players in England by the touring [[West Indies cricket team|West Indian cricket team]] in 1933 that demonstrated to the country the dangers it posed. The MCC subsequently revised the [[Laws of Cricket]] to prevent the use of &quot;fast leg theory&quot; tactics in future, also limiting the traditional tactic.\\n',\n",

When the [[pH]] of this solution rises, as a result of [[concentration|dilution]] by fresh water, these ions [[precipitation (chemistry)|precipitate]], forming [[Acid mine drainage#Yellow boy|&quot;Yellow Boy&quot;]] pollution. For these reasons, a setup of bioleaching must be carefully planned, since the process can lead to a [[biosafety]] failure.

       " b\"'''Bouldering''' is a form of [[rock climbing]] that is performed on small rock formations or artificial [[climbing wall|rock walls]], known as [[boulder]]s, without the use of ropes or [[Climbing harness|harnesses]]. While it can be done without any equipment, most climbers use [[climbing shoe]]s to help secure footholds, [[Magnesium carbonate|chalk]] to keep their hands dry and provide a firmer grip, and [[bouldering mat]]s to prevent injuries from falls. Unlike [[free solo climbing]], which is also performed without ropes, bouldering problems (the sequence of moves that a climber performs to complete the climb) are usually less than 6 meters (20 ft.) tall. Traverses, which are a form of boulder problem, require the climber to climb horizontally from one end to another. &lt;ref name=&quot;Access2006&quot;/&gt;{{rp|3}} [[Indoor climbing|Artificial climbing walls]] allow boulderers to train indoors in areas without natural boulders. In addition, [[Competition climbing|Bouldering competitions]] take place in both indoor and outdoor settings.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.stonecountry.co.uk/page11.html ''The Boulder: A Philosophy for Bouldering'' (Stone Country Press] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130816065033/http://www.stonecountry.co.uk/page11.html |date=16 August 2013 }}, by Francis Sanzaro, for a more on bouldering movement, and its relation to other sports.

Using the same protection as standard bouldering climbers venture up house sized rocks that test not only their physical skill and strength but mental focus. Highballing, like most of climbing, is open to interpretation. Most climbers say anything above 15 feet is a highball and can range in height up to 35\\xe2\\x80\\x9340 feet where highball bouldering then turns into [[free soloing]]. \\n',\n",

Climbing shoes typically fit much tighter than other athletic footwear and often curl the toes downwards to enable precise footwork. They are manufactured in a variety of different styles to perform in different situations. For example, High-top shoes provide better protection for the ankle, while low-top shoes provide greater flexibility and freedom of movement. Stiffer shoes excel at securing small edges, whereas softer shoes provide greater sensitivity. The front of the shoe, called the &quot;toe box&quot;, can be asymmetric, which performs well on overhanging rocks, or symmetric, which is better suited for vertical problems and [[slab climbing|slabs]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Sherman2011&quot;/&gt;{{rp|1}}&amp;thinsp;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kidd2009&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title= Rock Climbing |author1=Kidd, Timothy W.  |author2=Hazelrigs, Jennifer  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2009 |publisher=Human Kinetics |isbn=9781450409001 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OUYSi6Zem6gC }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|116}}&amp;thinsp;&lt;ref name=&quot;Beal2011&quot;/&gt;{{rp|ch.&amp;nbsp;2}}\\n\",\n",

A given pure compound has only one normal boiling point, if any, and a compound's normal boiling point and [[melting point]] can serve as characteristic [[Physical property|physical properties]] for that compound, listed in reference books.  The higher a compound's normal boiling point, the less volatile that compound is overall, and conversely, the lower a compound's normal boiling point, the more volatile that compound is overall.  Some compounds decompose at higher temperatures before reaching their normal boiling point, or sometimes even their melting point.  For a stable compound, the boiling point ranges from its [[triple point]] to its [[Critical point (thermodynamics)|critical point]], depending on the external pressure.  Beyond its triple point, a compound's normal boiling point, if any, is higher than its melting point.  Beyond the critical point, a compound's liquid and vapor phases merge into one phase, which may be called a superheated gas.  At any given temperature, if a compound's normal boiling point is lower, then that compound will generally exist as a gas at atmospheric external pressure.  If the compound's normal boiling point is higher, then that compound can exist as a liquid or solid at that given temperature at atmospheric external pressure, and will so exist in equilibrium with its vapor (if volatile) if its vapors are contained.   If a compound's vapors are not contained, then some volatile compounds can eventually evaporate away in spite of their higher boiling points.\\n\",\n",

Very generally\\xe2\\x80\\x94with other factors being equal\\xe2\\x80\\x94in compounds with covalently bonded [[molecule]]s, as the size of the molecule (or [[molecular mass]]) increases, the normal boiling point increases.  When the molecular size becomes that of a [[macromolecule]], [[polymer]], or otherwise very large, the compound often decomposes at high temperature before the boiling point is reached.  Another factor that affects the normal boiling point of a compound is the [[Polarity (chemistry)|polarity]] of its molecules.  As the polarity of a compound's molecules increases, its normal boiling point increases, other factors being equal.  Closely related is the ability of a molecule to form [[hydrogen bond]]s (in the liquid state), which makes it harder for molecules to leave the liquid state and thus increases the normal boiling point of the compound.  Simple [[carboxylic acid]]s dimerize by forming hydrogen bonds between molecules.  A minor factor affecting boiling points is the shape of a molecule.  Making the shape of a molecule more compact tends to lower the normal boiling point slightly compared to an equivalent molecule with more surface area.\\n\",\n",

Vapor pressures and boiling points of substances can be affected by the presence of dissolved impurities ([[Solution|solutes]]) or other miscible compounds, the degree of effect depending on the concentration of the impurities or other compounds.  The presence of non-volatile impurities such as [[Salt (chemistry)|salts]] or compounds of a [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatility]] far lower than the main component compound decreases its [[mole fraction]] and the [[Solution (chemistry)|solution's]] volatility, and thus raises the normal boiling point in proportion to the [[concentration]] of the solutes.

The dew point is a temperature at which a vapor [[Condensation|condenses]] into a liquid.   Furthermore, at any given temperature, the composition of the vapor is different from the composition of the liquid in most such cases.  In order to illustrate these effects between the volatile components in a mixture, a '''boiling point diagram''' is commonly used.
