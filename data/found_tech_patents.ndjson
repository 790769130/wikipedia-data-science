An operational scheme is employed wherein the storage node is first set to a defined voltage, the photocurrent is allowed to discharge the storage node and then the remaining charge coupled as a first signal to the column output circuitry, which samples and stores the first signal. The storage node is then reset to the same defined voltage and the resulting charge on the storage node is coupled as a second signal to the column output circuitry. The column output circuitry computes the difference of the first and second signals, which provides a reliable measure of the photocurrent during the integration period."]

["Adaptive image resolution enhancement technology ", "An Adaptive Image Resolution Enhancement Technology (IRET) process and apparatus is described to improve halftone imaging by changing ordered halftone screen resolution according to the content of the image and managing these changes based on image content. The Adaptive IRET halftoning technique maximizes the artifact reducing properties of coarser ordered screens, while minimizing the loss of rendered detail in image areas having high spatial frequency. IRET may utilize a mixture of any ordered halftone screen (e.g. clustered-dot dither, line screen, etc.) to generate halftone dots with a number of levels, and any dispersed halftone screen to generate additional levels for the ordered halftone dots. For some printing technologies, it is preferable to minimize printing artifacts by generating coarser halftone screens, rather than finer halftone screens. Coarser screening, however, means that details in the image, text, and line art will not be rendered well. Adaptive IRET uses an activity index to change its ordered halftone screen resolution according to the content of the image. To render a page with a mixture of text, line art, area fill, and photograph, it is preferable to render the \u201cbusy\u201d areas, such as text, line art, and edge regions in a photograph, with a higher resolution screen. On the other hand, smooth areas, such as area fill and non-edge regions in a photograph, are better rendered with a lower resolution screen."]

Optionally permanent magnets may be used in the process, alone or with an induction coil."]

Throughout late stance, joint impedance is minimized so as not to impede powered plantar flexion movements, and during the swing phase, a torsional spring-damper (PD) control lifts the foot to provide toe clearance. To assess the clinical effects of variable-impedance control, kinetic and kinematic gait data were collected on two drop foot participants wearing the AAFO. It has been found that actively adjusting joint impedance reduces the occurrence of slap foot, allows greater powered plantar flexion, and provides for less kinematic difference during swing when compared to normals."]

In particular, this technology relates to ranking of search results and compiling an index against which to search."]
["Highly scalable architecture for application network appliances ", "A highly scalable application network appliance is described herein. According to one embodiment, a network element includes a switch fabric, a first service module coupled to the switch fabric, and a second service module coupled to the first service module over the switch fabric. In response to packets of a network transaction received from a client over a first network to access a server of a data center having multiple servers over a second network, the first service module is configured to perform a first portion of OSI (open system interconnection) compatible layers of network processes on the packets while the second service module is configured to perform a second portion of the OSI compatible layers of network processes on the packets. The first portion includes at least one OSI compatible layer that is not included in the second portion. Other methods and apparatuses are also described."]
["Method for producing an L-amino acid ", "An L-amino acid is produced by culturing a bacterium having an L-amino acid-producing ability in a medium containing a processed product of a microalga which promotes production and accumulation of the L-amino acid by the bacterium. The process product is produced by disrupting the culture of the microalga, and/or extracting the culture of the microalga, or fractionating the culture of the microalga or the disrupted culture. The processed product contains a mixture of organic substances produced by the microalga, a hydrolysate of the disrupted microalga culture, and/or an extract or fractionation product of the microalga culture. The processed product can also contain a saccarification product of starch or a hydrolysate of fats and oils. The bacterium is cultured to produce and accumulate the L-amino acid in culture, and the L-amino acid is collected from the culture."]
["Polyamides for nucleic acid delivery ", "A new class of non-viral transduction vectors that can be used for both in vivo and in vitro applications, including, a gene transfer vector that has comparable efficiency to a viral vector without the potential for a life-threatening immune response is provided. Complexes including a cellular delivery molecule or agent that can facilitate the translocation of the complex or portion thereof into cells is also provided. The cellular delivery molecules may include one or more polymers, e.g., polyamides, dendritic macromolecules and carbohydrate-containing degradable polyesters."]
["User interface with three dimensional user input ", "A device and method for image manipulation is provided. The image manipulation may be performed as a function of a three dimensional user input and image or application specific data regarding the displayed image to be manipulated. The three dimensional input may be in the form of a two dimensional position on a touch screen and a measured force in the third dimension. The image or application specific data may be in the form of a maximum depth value indicating the maximum depth of the displayed image. The system may be configured to adjust the image based on a percentage of the measured user input force and a threshold force. The image may be adjusted based on the percentage and the maximum depth."]
["Methods and apparatus for object detection and identification in a multiple detector lidar array ", "LiDAR (light detection and ranging) systems use one or more emitters and a detector array to cover a given field of view where the emitters each emit a single pulse or a multi-pulse packet of light that is sampled by the detector array. On each emitter cycle the detector array will sample the incoming signal intensity at the pre-determined sampling frequency that generates two or more samples per emitted light packet to allow for volumetric analysis of the retroreflected signal portion of each emitted light packet as reflected by one or more objects in the field of view and then received by each detector."]
["Variety corn line NPDC6326 ", "The present invention provides an inbred corn line designated NPDC6326, methods for producing a corn plant by crossing plants of the inbred line NPDC6326 with plants of another corn plant. The invention further encompasses all parts of inbred corn line NPDC6326, including culturable cells. Additionally provided herein are methods for introducing transgenes into inbred corn line NPDC6326, and plants produced according to these methods."]
