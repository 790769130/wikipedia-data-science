["A rapid method and apparatus for remapping the type of service (TOS) and source address information from an incoming communications packet according to the desired Quality of Service (QoS) required for the communications flow into a switch or router are described. The input source address field of the packet header is used to access a lookup table of corresponding source autonomous system (AS) labels. The appropriate AS label is combined with the input TOS yielding an intra-switch TOS optimized for the QoS appropriate to the received flow. Alternatively, the netID, a subset of the source address, may be used directly without resort to a lookup table. As a further alternative, the destination address may be used in conjunction with the above. The resulting intra-switch TOS expedites packet management and throughput in the switch/router, facilitating the efficient delivery of the required Quality of Service for that flow.", "Hardware TOS remapping based on source autonomous system identifier "]
